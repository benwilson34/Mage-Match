To build the MMDebug library;

1. Open MMDebug.sln in Visual Studio

2. You need to include UnityEngine.dll from your Unity install. In the Solution Explorer (if you 
don't see it, go to View->Solution Explorer) click on the dropdown arrow next to MMDebug in the tree
view; then right click References and click Add Reference... Now click on Browse on the left and then
the Browse... button on the bottom and navigate to the library. For me the path is:
	C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor\Data\Managed\UnityEngine.dll
	
3. Press Ctrl+Shift+B or go to Build->Build Solution to build the library

4. Move the newly built MMDebug.dll from ...\Mage-Match\MMDebug\MMDebug\bin\Debug to the Assets/Plugins folder.
